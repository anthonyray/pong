/*
*	PONG
*/

This is the first game I developped thanks to the GreatCodeClub ! 

/*
*	How to browse the code
*/

Here are the files you should take a look at, in logical order:

1. `game.html` is the page containing the `<canvas>` we render the game on.
2. `game.js` is the game engine, mainly the game loop.
3. `pong.js` initializes the game and the entities.
4. `entity.js` contains the base class for all game entities.
5. `ball.js` is the ball entity. Boing!
6. `paddles.js` is the logic for the player and computer controlled paddles.
